## Inspiration
I have seen people around me, including myself, fall prey to minor negative behaviors because we think it's not a big problem. In reality, the effects compound, and your reinforcement continues to overpower your efforts to overcome it.
One personal bad habit that I picked up was pulling my mustache, which is essentially very similar to biting your nails. Back When I used to live with my family I would always find my sister biting her nails and it somewhat disgusted me. Funny enough, a few years later, I started playing with and pulling my mustache and it continued to get worse. Now it is wasting so much of my time and I couldn't find any way to overcome it other than building this app

## What it does
Empower users to be more mindful of their actions by having their laptop camera monitor them and alert them when they commit a bad habit/addiction they have configured in the web app.

## How I built it
With the motivation of helping myself. Saving me around 30 minutes every day. I also believe it's a pain point in other people's lives as well.
Used convex as a backend to store user's data and to enable the ability to have friends to expose your bad habits to.
Implemented several 'Actions' that I used for several external APIs that I used like cohere, Elevenlabs, and resend. I also found the process very smooth with adding an auth system with Convex Auth. I'm a big fan of tRPC so I'm glad y'all took inspiration from them and made Convex also end-to-end type-safe.


## Challenges I ran into
Convex's way of doing things. Nothing can beat a stack you've already worked with before. Especially if you want speed.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Unfortunately, I worked solo but managed to get into the flow, got a lot done, and enjoyed myself in that process.

## What I learned
Image Recognition in the Web
Convex backend
The value of having teammates in hackathons. Makes it a whole another experience compared to hacking solo.

## What's next for StopIt!
You can follow other people who you trust them in knowing your bad habits
A team of habit breakers who put some money in. Whoever loses will have to give out the money among the other breakers
Gamifying
